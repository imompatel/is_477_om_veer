We identified the Billboard HOT 100 & more Kaggle dataset, which has an open and public License through Creative Commons and has a DOI citation as well. Hence, we decided to go with that dataset, which included data from 1963 - 2022. We are using this data to find attributes like Danceability, Tempo, Time, Genre etc., through which we want to compare to Spotify's API to retrieve its top 100 songs from 2000 - 2025 and see how music has changed over time and what attributes correlate with higher chart performance. While that was the original plan was to test danceability, energy, tempo, valence, acousticness, speechiness, instrumentalness, liveness (compositional traits)
and popularity, as we started pulling data, we realized that there is a lot of data and attributes that would need to be cleaned up, and that would make our data almost impossible to use. Hence, we are now deciding to go with one quantitative data attribute (like danceability or time) and a qualitative data attribute (like genre).
