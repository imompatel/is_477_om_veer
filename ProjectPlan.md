1. Overview

The goal of this project is to analyze the evolution of popular music and determine what makes a song a Billboard Hot 100 hit. By combining data from two sources — the Billboard Hot 100 Historical Dataset and Spotify's Web API audio features — we can determine how musical attributes such as tempo, danceability, and energy contribute to chart success.

By combining decades' worth of Billboard chart behavior with quantitative audio features from Spotify, this project will seek to identify patterns that explain why some songs become commercially successful while others do not. Additionally, it will examine whether and to what extent these "hit song" characteristics have changed since the 1960s to the current streaming era.

The project will cover the entire data lifecycle, from acquisition through cleaning, integration, and quality checking to reproducible analysis. The final deliverables are an integrated dataset, statistical findings, and visualizations that are clear evidence of popular music evolution.

2. Research Questions

A.)What specific musical attributes (such as danceability, energy, tempo, and valence) are most strongly associated with higher chart performance on the Billboard Hot 100?

B.)How have these key musical features evolved across decades (1960s–2020s)?

C.)Are there measurable differences between “hit” songs in the pre-streaming era and the modern digital/streaming era?

D.)Is there a relationship between a song’s audio profile and its longevity on the charts (measured by weeks on the chart)?
